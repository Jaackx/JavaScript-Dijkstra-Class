JavaScript-Dijkstra-Class
=========================

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm JavaScript.

Before working with this class you need to download this class that I've found here 

https://github.com/lu1s/Directed-Graph/blob/master/DirectedGraph.js

The way you use it is as follows :

var Djik = new Djikstra(graph, "A");

var path = [];

path = Djik.bestPath("A","Q");
